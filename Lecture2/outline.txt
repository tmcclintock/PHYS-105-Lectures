Lecture 1
- logging in
- changing password with passwd
- introduce myself and Alex
- syllabus
- "you are using a terminal, connecting this machine to a different one"
- open a program in emacs
- hello world program
-- C programming language runs linearly from top to bottom
-- the program starts from the word main and goes down from there
-- this is one line, and it prints "Hello world!" using the printf funciton
-- functions are tools at your disposal, and you will learn dozens of them,
as well as how to create your own. printf is probably the most often used
function, and you will use it over and over again
- The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie (FREE ONLINE)
- assign homework 1/in class assignment 1

Homework 1
- take hello world and add comments to it
- needed comments include: name, class section, short description of program, 
directions on how to compile and run
- must be submitted on d2l

Lecture 2
- last time: terminal basics (logging in, emacs), hello.c
- show how to see graded homework 1 and feedback
- more terminal commands: history, ls (list), mkdir, cd
- discuss the use of variables, as well as declarations, initializations,
and assignments, as well as some math on them
- state that variable names can be WHATEVER YOU WANT!!
- show how to print variables, and show how to read ERROR MESSAGES
- variables.c
-- declare float x, y
-- declare and initialize (sameline) float a=1.5, b=2
-- declare int i
-- assign i = 1
-- declare and initialize j = 2
-- assign x = 3.1415
-- assign y = a*x + b
-- printf( Integer i and integer j\n)
-- printf("%f = ", y)
-- printf("%f * %f + %f \n",a,x,b)
-- put in an error by assigning z = 0.1 without declaring it
- discuss I/O, and demonstrate how to store input into a variable
- inout.c
-- declare num1, num2
-- scanf for num1 and num2
-- printf num1, num2, and num1*num2
- in class assignment 2: temperature convert
-- write a program that takes in from the user (input, using scanf) a
temperature in F. Store this number in a variable (perhaps called Ftemp, or
fahr, or something like that)
-- calculate what this temperature is in celsius C = 0.556 * F - 17.78
-- print out the message "Temperature FFF degrees Fahrenheit is 
CCC degrees Celsius"
